  <p>Before anything else, I want to write a bit about how I&rsquo;ve set things up on the
site. At some point later I&rsquo;ll write about why I set it up this way.</p>
<p>The blog is published as a git archive on GitHub. I use a static site generator
(Hugo) to publish the content from markdown files.  Each commit is signed with
a GPG key that&rsquo;s associated with my GitHub account, and the public key can be
found in the repo and on keyservers. After committing, I use OpenTimestamps to
generate a trusted timestamp, and then commit the resulting OTS file for
verification to the archive as well.</p>
<p>In this way, I think I can count on the following guarantees being held:</p>
<ul>
<li>git ensures that the integrity of the blog is kept</li>
<li>signing the commits ensures that I&rsquo;m actually the one making updates</li>
<li>OpenTimestamps ensures that posts are immutable once committed and published</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a security expert, but I&rsquo;m reasonably confident that at least after
the first few updates to the blog, it would require an unreasonable amount of
effort to fake content or rewrite history.</p>
<p>My intent is to have largely two types of content here: one are posts, which
are written addressing some external audience about some topic(s) that I want
to write about. The second is a Zettelkasten-style knowledge base linking
together a bunch of stuff that ends up in my head. Posts I intend to be write-
once, update never or rarely, and order chronologically. In contrast, the kb
articles may be updated, renamed, or deleted; they may make no sense to anyone
(including me); there is no natural ordering.</p>
<p>As of the initial writing, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a standard a way to generate
backlinks between pieces with Hugo, so the implementation of intent may end up
diverging a bit from what&rsquo;s written here. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
