Here are the files necessary to verify the authenticity of blog updates. The
content in the commit files should match the git history for this site. The
signatures should be verifyable with my public key, which can be found here:
[0bfd_pub.asc](/0bfd_pub.asc) or on public keyservers.

See [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org/) for more information on
how to verify the timestamp files. I used their git integration as inspiration
for what content to timestamp.
